> map data tasks to QBP tasks
sometimes, all have to be done; other cases, a few
turn into stages, min-number property, extent of adherence

> new model elements: 
* all tasks of a certain subtype are completed
    e.g., cultures done
~ decision table for task configuration

> bunch of conditions that are unknown...
indicate "knowable" so they don't have to fire for task to be activated
* reverse engineer actual criteria?? 
    e.g., what is "low" for low O2; stratify O2 observations
    cases with outcomes for unknown decisional process; how did we get there?
